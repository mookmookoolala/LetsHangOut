High-Level Architecture
User Interface (UI):

Technology: React (front-end framework)
Purpose: Provides the interface through which users interact with the application.
API Gateway:

Technology: Amazon API Gateway (optional)
Purpose: Manages and routes HTTP requests from the UI to the back-end services.
Back-End Services:

Technology: Node.js with Express (back-end framework)
Purpose: Handles business logic, processes requests, and interacts with the database.
Database:

Technology: Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL database)
Purpose: Stores application data, such as user information, lobbies, availability, and votes.
Containerization and Orchestration:

Technology: Docker, AWS Fargate (serverless container orchestration)
Purpose: Containerizes the application and orchestrates the deployment and scaling of containers.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Technology: AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild
Purpose: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
Monitoring and Logging:

Technology: Amazon CloudWatch
Purpose: Monitors application performance, logs events, and sets up alerts for specific metrics.
Detailed System Design
1. User Interface (UI)
Components:

Lobby Creation: Allows users to create a new lobby with a unique code.
Calendar: Allows users to select their availability.
Propose Places: Allows users to propose meeting places.
Voting System: Allows users to vote on proposed places.
Interactions:

User actions trigger API calls to the back-end services.
Responses from the back-end are rendered in the UI.
2. API Gateway (Optional)
Role:
Manages HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate back-end services.
Provides additional security features, such as request throttling and authentication.
3. Back-End Services
Components:

Authentication: Handles user registration and login using JWT.
Lobby Management: Manages lobby creation, retrieval, and updates.
Availability Management: Manages user availability data.
Voting Management: Manages proposal and voting data.
Interactions:

Receives HTTP requests from the UI or API Gateway.
Processes requests, performs business logic, and interacts with the database.
Sends responses back to the UI or API Gateway.
4. Database
Tables:

Users: Stores user information.
Lobbies: Stores lobby details.
Availability: Stores user availability for each lobby.
Votes: Stores proposed places and votes.
Interactions:

Back-end services perform CRUD operations on the database.
Data is retrieved, stored, updated, or deleted based on business logic.
5. Containerization and Orchestration
Docker:

Containerizes the front-end and back-end applications for consistency across different environments.
Dockerfiles define the environment and dependencies for each application.
AWS Fargate:

Manages the deployment, scaling, and load balancing of Docker containers.
Removes the need to manage underlying server infrastructure.
6. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
AWS CodePipeline:

Automates the end-to-end build, test, and deployment process.
Triggers builds and deployments based on code changes in the source repository.
AWS CodeBuild:

Builds the Docker images for the front-end and back-end applications.
Runs tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
7. Monitoring and Logging
Amazon CloudWatch:
Collects and stores logs from the application and infrastructure.
Monitors metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and response times.
Sets up alarms to notify when specific thresholds are breached.

Practical Steps
Set Up Your Development Environment:

Install Node.js, npm, and Docker.
Initialize the React front-end and Node.js back-end projects.
Define Infrastructure as Code:

Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define your AWS infrastructure (ECS cluster, Fargate services, DynamoDB tables).
Implement CI/CD Pipelines:

Set up AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate the build and deployment process.
Write a buildspec.yml file for CodeBuild.
Deploy the Application:

Push Docker images to Amazon ECR.
Deploy the application to AWS Fargate.
Monitor and Manage:

Configure CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
Set up alerts for critical metrics.
